# Dynamic Deures

> Online math worksheet generator.

Dynamic Deures is a Flask (python) web app that generates personalized math worksheets (with different numbers each time).
The worksheets are generated via PyLaTeX (LaTeX running in python), and the result is a pdf that is shown to the user so that she/he can print it on the go.

## Notes for developers
For PyLaTeX to run in your local machine you'll need MacTeX or something along the way (I got it to work with MacTeX, which is 6Gb, and couldn't make it work with anything smaller than that).

Otherwise, it's quite easy to make it run (for free) in pythonAnywhere.com, since they already have LaTeX installed by default (which is exactly how I made this before version control).

### Cloning the repo
Because of the feedback system I made with Telegram (a bot tells me when a pdf is generated and also its kind), if you clone the repo (to gossip or contribute) you'll need to make a little adjustment: the file named `telegramor.examply` needs to be copied under the name `telegramor.py`, as it's explained inside the file itself.

Not doing so will throw an error in the moment of building the pdf (since it won't be able to import the bot's secret key, which I haven't included for obvious reasons).

_On the other hand, in my local copy PyCharm signals an import error with my own local modules, though then it runs just fine._
